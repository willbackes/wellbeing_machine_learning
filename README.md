# Comparative Analysis of Predictive Models on Human Wellbeing

This project is centered around exploring the application of machine learning techniques
to predict human wellbeing, comparing traditional econometric methods, such as Ordinary
Least Squares (OLS), with modern algorithms like Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
Operator (LASSO), Random Forests (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB). Inspired by the work
of Oparina et al. (2023), the aim is to assess the effectiveness of various models in
predicting human wellbeing.

### Data

The dataset for this project is sourced from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP),
covering the years 2010 to 2018. This timeframe aligns with the original paper, and
flexibility is maintained to consider other years as long as data remains available.

### Data Management and Variables of Interest

Focus will be placed on the "restricted set" mentioned in the paper, including variables
such as Age, Area of Residence, BMI, Disability Status, Education, Labour-force status,
Log HH income, Ethnicity/Migration Background, Health, Housing Status, Marital Status,
Month of Interview, Number of children in HH, Number of people in HH, Religion, Sex, and
Working Hours. Categorical data will be transformed into sets of dummy variables for
analysis.

### Analysis

a) Generate descriptive statistics for the variables of interest. b) Utilize the four
algorithms to regress life satisfaction on the variables of interest. c) Compute
performance metrics as RÂ². d) Compare performance metrics across the different models.

### Figures/Final Analysis

Produce figures akin to those presented in Oparina et al. (2023), encompassing model
performance, performance improvement through the use of machine learning, variable
importance, and wellbeing patterns concerning age and income.

### Additional

a) Consider expanding the dataset by including other years for a more comprehensive
analysis. b) Explore and apply additional machine learning algorithms beyond the ones
mentioned in the original paper. c) Compare the performance of these new algorithms with
those previously examined. As a considerable amount of time was spent on cleaning the
data and selecting relevant variables, the additional part was disconsidered for this
project and only the replication of the paper was maintained (the original code for this
project was not available).
